        <p><abbr title="computer-related">Web development</abbr> is a critical part of bringing business ideas to life.<mark> In the 21st century, a solid web presence is essential for any business.</mark> This is because it gives potential customers a
        glimpse into the company culture and values, whilst also helping with branding and marketing. <small>It also provides
        customers with a consistent experience across different platforms.</small> Web development is also important because it can help you stand out from competitors who are not as <code>tech-savvy</code>. If your
        website looks dated or unprofessional, customers may be turned off by your brand, even if they are interested in your
        products or services.</p>
        <pre>Web development can also help customers build relationships with your business. For example, social media platforms can
        be used to share news about new products or services. This helps build trust between you and your customers because
        they will feel like they are getting inside information.</pre>
